Whisky, gambling and Ferraris are better than housework. -Françoise Sagan Women don’t get raped because they were drinking or took drugs. Women do not get raped because they weren’t careful enough. Women get raped because someone raped them. -Jessica Valenti I love being single. It’s almost like being rich. -Sue Grafton In fact, there is perhaps only one human being in a thousand who is passionately interested in his job for the job’s sake. The difference is that if that one person in a thousand is a man, we say, simply, that he is passionately keen on his job; if she is a woman, we say she is a freak. -Dorothy L. Sayers While falling in love is fun, it’s not everything, and it’s not the antidote to an unfulfilled life, despite what Reese Witherspoon movies may tell you. -Jessica Valenti There will be no mass-based feminist movement as long as feminist ideas are understood only by a well-educated few. -bell hooks
